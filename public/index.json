To address visual scalability, this interface communicates with the user via a 'tip of the iceberg' approach, where the user interacts with a small set of recommended instances for each class. To address computational scalability, we developed an O (n) classification algorithm that incorporates user feedback incrementally, and without consulting the data's underlying representation matrix. Our computational evaluation showed that this algorithm has similar accuracy to several off-the-shelf classification algorithms with small amounts of labeled data. Empirical evaluation revealed that users performed better using our design compared to an equivalent active learning setup.","tags":["visual interactive labeling","interactive machine learning","active learning","representation-free classifier"],"title":"Towards rapid interactive machine learning: evaluating tradeoffs of classification without representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539662400,"objectID":"170eaa41c8140a98b769d89c58a95137","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/talk/xai-davidson/","publishdate":"2018-10-16T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/xai-davidson/","section":"talk","summary":"Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have provided substantial gains in many predictive tasks like image recognition, text classification, and speech recognition. However, implementing such models in practice, especially for decision-making, can be difficult as these models are inherently opaque, non-intuitive, and difficult to interpret. This talk will explore the role of explainable systems built on top of such models to enable informed decision-making processes. Originally introduced by DARPA, the U.S. Department of Defense’s research arm, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging field that aims to create machine learning techniques that (1) produce more explainable models while maintaining high predictive accuracy and (2) enable human users to understand, trust, and manage the outcomes from such models.","tags":["explainable ai","machine learning","visual analytics","cognitive science"],"title":"Explainable AI: Opening up the black box","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531886400,"objectID":"79abbf8897613c963b391aa542faa309","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/talk/dsi-interactive-viz/","publishdate":"2018-07-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/dsi-interactive-viz/","section":"talk","summary":"In this three part workshop series, I introduce interactive visualization in RStudio with tools like shiny, htmlwidgets, and flexdashboard.","tags":["r","shiny","htmlwidgets","rmarkdown"],"title":"Interactive Visualizations with RStudio Workshops","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ryan Wesslen","Sagar Nandu","Omar Eltayeby","Tiffany Gallicano","Sara Levens","Min Jiang","Samira Shaikh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529035200,"objectID":"1625062e006e869ab07916cc8675ec02","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/publication/icwsm-2018-2/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icwsm-2018-2/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe a novel longitudinal study of the frequency and significance of social media users' profile changes. Drawing upon two formative theories from communication and psychology: self-construal and signaling theory, we examine the likelihood that users will change their profiles and what constitutes a significant profile change. Our findings indicate that users are more likely to change their Profile Summaries and Display Names than their Locations and Screen Names (i.e. handles). Further, we used topic modeling to partition users based on their profiles to identify themes and explored how profile changes differ among these thematic groups (e.g., Trump supporters). Last, we identified the most significant word changes by users in their profiles. Our findings provide valuable baseline data for further study of Twitter profiles, including the spread of social contagion through these profiles.","tags":["social media","twitter profiles","signaling theory","self-construal"],"title":"Bumper Stickers on the Twitter Highway: Analyzing the Speed and Substance of Profile Changes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alireza Karduni","Ryan Wesslen","Sashank Santhanam","Isaac Cho","Svitlana Volkova","Dustin Arendt","Samira Shaikh","Wenwen Dou"],"categories":null,"content":"Verifi (below) can be accessed at https://verifi.herokuapp.com.

Using a custom-built visual analytic system, we presented users with news content from social media accounts from a variety of news outlets, including outlets engaged in distributing misinformation. We conducted controlled experiments to study decision-making regarding the veracity of these news outlets and tested the role of confirmation bias (the tendency to ignore contradicting information) and uncertainty of information on human decision-making processes. Our findings reveal that the presence of conflicting information, presented to users in the form of cues, impacts the ability to judge the veracity of news in systematic ways. We also find that even instructing participants to explicitly disconfirm given hypotheses does not significantly impact their decision-making regarding misinformation when compared to a control condition.

Despite the availability of text and advances in text analysis methods, many of these techniques remain largely segmented by discipline. Moreover, there is an increasing number of open-source tools (R, Python) for text analysis, yet these tools are not easily taken advantage of by social science researchers who likely have limited programming knowledge and exposure to computational methods. In this article, we compare quantitative and qualitative text analysis methods used across social sciences. We describe basic terminology and the overlooked, but critically important, steps in pre-processing raw text (e.g., selection of stop words; stemming). Next, we provide an exploratory analysis of open-ended responses from a prototypical survey dataset using topic modeling with R. We provide a list of best practice recommendations for text analysis focused on (1) hypothesis and question formation, (2) design and data collection, (3) data pre-processing, and (4) topic modeling. We also discuss the creation of scale scores for more traditional correlation and regression analyses. All the data are available in an online repository for the interested reader to practice with, along with a reference list for additional reading, an R markdown file, and an open source interactive topic model tool.","tags":["text analysis","topic modeling","structural topic modeling","thematic analysis"],"title":"A Review of Best Practice Recommendations for Text Analysis in R (and a User-Friendly App)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isaac Cho","Ryan Wesslen","Svitlana Volkova","William Ribarsky","Wenwen Dou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506830400,"objectID":"bc630d66afccf1735648de666317e07c","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/publication/vast-2017-2/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vast-2017-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Social media data bear valuable insights regarding events that occur around the world. Events are inherently temporal and spatial. Existing visual text analysis systems have focused on detecting and analyzing past and ongoing events. Few have leveraged social media information to look for events that may occur in the future. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytic system, CrystalBall, that automatically identifies and ranks future events from Twitter streams. CrystalBall integrates new methods to discover events with interactive visualizations that permit sensemaking of the identified future events. Our computational methods integrate seven different measures to identify and characterize future events, leveraging information regarding time, location, social networks, and the informativeness of the messages. A visual interface is tightly coupled with the computational methods to present a concise summary of the possible future events. A novel connection graph and glyphs are designed to visualize the characteristics of the future events. To demonstrate the efficacy of CrystalBall in identifying future events and supporting interactive analysis, we present multiple case studies and validation studies on analyzing events derived from Twitter data.","tags":["visual analytics","misinformation","cognitive biases"],"title":"CrystalBall: A Visual Analytic System for Future Event Discovery and Analysis from Social Media Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isaac Cho","Ryan Wesslen","Alireza Karduni","Sashank Santhanam","Samira Shaikh","Wenwen Dou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506830400,"objectID":"0fd2a64bc7249ede51afa64472040759","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/publication/vast-2017-1/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vast-2017-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Anchoring effect is the tendency to focus too heavily on one piece of information when making decisions. In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decisionmaking. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.","tags":["visual analytics","event detection","cognitive biases"],"title":"The Anchoring Effect in Decision-Making with Visual Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.com/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
