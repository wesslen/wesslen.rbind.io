These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VitaLITy, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VitaLITy promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VitaLITy visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VitaLITy also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VitaLITy, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VitaLITy, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.","tags":["transformers","word embeddings","literature review","web scraper","dataset","visual analytics"],"title":"VitaLITy: Promoting Serendipitous Discovery of Academic Literature with Transformers \u0026 Visual Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627012800,"objectID":"57d6d3d7994b3e5729ae4e32fb33b3d7","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.app/talk/dissertation-defense/","publishdate":"2021-07-23T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/dissertation-defense/","section":"talk","summary":"In this thesis, we hypothesize that data visualization users are subject to systematic errors, or cognitive biases, in decision-making under uncertainty. Based on research from psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive science, we design five experiments to measure the role of anchoring bias, confirmation bias, belief bias, and myopic loss aversion under different uncertain decision tasks like social media event detection, misinformation identification, and financial portfolio allocation. This thesis makes three major contributions. First, we find evidence of cognitive biases in data visualization through multiple behavioral trace data including user decisions, user hover and click interactions, qualitative feedback, and belief elicitation techniques. Second, we design multiple experiments with interactive data visualization systems across different design complexities (coordinated multiple views to single plot), data types (social network, linguistic, geospatial, temporal, statistical), and evaluate them on user populations that range from novice to expert (crowdsourced, undergraduate, data scientist, domain expert). Third, we evaluate the experiments using multiple statistical and probabilistic techniques to measure the effects of cognitive biases including classical statistical tests, (Bayesian) mixed effects modeling, hierarchical clustering, natural language processing, and Bayesian cognitive modeling. These experiments show the promising role data visualizations and human-computer techniques could mitigate such biases and lead to better decision-making under uncertainty.","tags":["human-computer interaction","information visualization","cognitive science","human-centered artificial intelligence","visual analytics","cognitive biases"],"title":"Cognitive biases in decision-making under uncertainty with interactive data visualizations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ryan Wesslen","Alireza Karduni","Douglas Markant","Wenwen Dou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626321600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626321600,"objectID":"0201e8f9ef0fdf013b5b674a78ad8823","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.app/publication/vis-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vis-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"For many households, investing for retirement is one of the most significant decisions and is fraught with uncertainty. In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.","tags":["uncertainty visualizations","myopic loss aversion","retirement investing","equity premium puzzle"],"title":"Effect of uncertainty visualizations on myopic loss aversion and equity premium puzzle in retirement investment decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619064000,"objectID":"abdabf12c39000f6f7c28b2b4860afb6","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.app/talk/2021-analytics-frontiers/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-analytics-frontiers/","section":"talk","summary":"From a once-in-a-century pandemic to volatile swings in stock markets to turbulent political elections, uncertainty is all around us. Yet why do so many data analysts, data scientists and data journalists tend to ignore uncertainty? Or worse, can bad uncertainty representations lead to biased decisions? In this talk, we explore research from information visualization that endeavors to design better uncertainty representations to enable better decision-making and human-computer interaction. Building from theories in psychology, cognitive science, and behavioral economics, novel visualization design strategies for uncertainty like frequency framing with icon arrays and animated sampling in hypothetical outcome plots have shown great promise for improving uncertain predictions, mitigating cognitive biases, and may even be key in fostering trust in black box machine learning. This talk will first outline how visualization researchers have applied such new uncertainty visualizations to everyday situations of interpretating COVID vaccine efficacy to hurricane forecasting to investing for retirement.

Prior work on correlation perception has not considered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a scatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate the belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed Line + Cone visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of belief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users' uncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the Line + Cone elicitation method to measure belief updating on the relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes in users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide normative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a relationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization without uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and explores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results highlight the effects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of measuring belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive models.","tags":["information visualization","bayesian modeling","uncertainty visualizations","correlations","belief elicitation"],"title":"A Bayesian cognition approach for belief updating of correlation judgement through uncertainty visualizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alireza Karduni","Ryan Wesslen","Isaac Cho","Wenwen Dou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585713600,"objectID":"a4fbb3c935951214be42f42269036b11","permalink":"https://wesslen.netlify.app/publication/chi-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chi-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a visualization technique, Du Bois wrapped bar chart, inspired by work of W.E.B Du Bois.

In the first study (n=98) using real-world datasets, we find that wrapped bar charts lead to higher accuracy in identifying and estimating ratios between bars. In a follow-up study (n=190) with 13 simulated datasets, we find participants were consistently more accurate with wrapped bar charts when certain category values are disproportionate as measured by entropy and H-spread.

Recent research suggests that cognitive biases, like numerical anchoring, transfers to visual analytics in the form of visual anchoring. However, it is unclear how visualization users can be visually anchored and how the anchors affect decision-making. To investigate, we performed a between-subjects laboratory experiment with 94 participants to analyze the effects of visual anchors and strategy cues using a visual analytics system. The decision-making task was to identify misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions that modified the scenario video (visual anchor) and/or strategy cues provided.

To address computational scalability, we developed an O (n) classification algorithm that incorporates user feedback incrementally, and without consulting the data's underlying representation matrix.
