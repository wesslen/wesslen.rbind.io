# Intro to Visual Analytics (and Information Visualization)

---

# What is a visualization?

## The use of computer-supported, interactive visual representations of data to **amplify cognition**. 

### - Card, Mackinley, and Shneiderman (1999)

---

# Data visualization is separated into three disciplines:

### - Scientific visualization (1987)

### - Information visualization (1999)

### - Visual analytics (2005)

# Information Visualization (InfoVis)

Low-level, system 1 processing 

Intuitive, perceptual decision-making

Single, isolated graph/chart

Typically, non-expert or average user

**Goal**: identify best external (visual) representation

---

# Visual Analytics (VA)

High-level, system 2 processing

Effortful, deliberate decision-making

Highly interactive, coordinated-multiple views

Typically, expert or specialized knowledge

**Goal**: "human-in-the-loop" decision-making (e.g., integrate with machine learning)

--

This course is called "Visual Analytics" but includes a lot on Information Visualization.

## Tufte's Perspective <img src="img/01-class/tufte.png" width="160px" align="right" />

1. Place data in an appropriate context for assessing **cause and effect**.

2. Making quantitatives comparisons (e.g., Workhouse & Brewery).

3. Considering alternative explanations and contrary cases.

4. Assessment for possible errors (e.g., compared with what?)

# Five Qualities of Great Visualizations

"But why do I never stumble on to an article or blog post showing ... how a visualization helped a group of doctors do something remarkable? Is it just because this stuff does not get reported or what?" -Enrico Bertini (NYU)

Chapter 2 of Cairo "The Truthful Art"

## Five Qualities of Great Visualizations

1. It is truthful.

2. It is functional.

3. It is beautiful.

4. It is insightful.

5. It is enlightening.

"If someone hides data from you, it’s probably because he has something to hide." (Cairo, Chapter 2)

---

"Truth and untruth aren’t absolutes. They are the extremes at either end of a spectrum" (Cairo, Chapter 2)

- Avoid self-deception

- Be honest with your audience

# It is insightful

“The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures" - Card, Mackinley, and Shneiderman (1999)

Two types of insight in data visualizations (Chang et al., 2009):

1. Eureka (or Aha!) moments

2. Knowledge-building

---

# It is enlightening

"Some topics do matter more than others indeed because **they are more critical to the well-being of more people.**"

--

- What is the importance of your data visualization?

--

- Find topics that are important (and fun) to understand, especially in cases where you don't know the right question to ask (i.e., exploratory data analysis).
